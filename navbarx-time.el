;;; Commentary:

;; This navbar item displays `display-time-string' in the navbar buffer
;; instead of the mode line.

;;; Code:

(require 'time)
(require 'navbar)

(defface navbarx-time
  '((t :inherit navbar-item))
  "Face of `navbarx-time'."
  :group 'navbar)

(defun navbarx-time-get ()
  (and display-time-string
       (list (substring-no-properties display-time-string)
	     :padding navbar-item-padding
	     :propertize '(face navbarx-time))))

(defun navbarx-time-on ()
  (setq global-mode-string
	(delq 'display-time-string global-mode-string))
  (add-hook 'display-time-hook #'navbarx-time-update)
  (display-time-update))

(defun navbarx-time-off ()
  (navbarx-time-update)
  (remove-hook 'display-time-hook #'navbarx-time-update))

;;;###autoload (autoload 'navbarx-time "navbarx-time")
(navbar-define-item navbarx-time
  "Navbar item for `display-time-mode' support."
  :get #'navbarx-time-get
  :mode display-time-mode
  :mode-on #'navbarx-time-on
  :mode-off #'navbarx-time-off)

(provide 'navbarx-time)
;;; navbarx-time.el ends here
